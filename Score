# =============================================================================
REMARKS from Archil:

# State
# dags failing when can be no new files. here you can use branching.

# readability
# bad variable Name, Non pep BUCKET_name
# no describing comments

# structure
# didn't used CRUD for CF
# hardcoded connections strings
# didn't used BranchPythonOperator as branching the dags with at least two outcomes
# Try/Except NotImplementedError, shouldn't be used as a general exception

# Repo
# service account creds in repo
# only main branch in repo, you should've have at least dev branch which you'd merge with main.

# Readme
# not described how the GCP works. only CRUD.

Commenst from Alex:
DO NOT UPLOAD YOUR CREDENTIALS TO REPO! :)
The descriptions and comments are limited and hard
to understand.
Commit Descriptions are also ambigious, although 
having the type of commit (update, fix, etc) was very nice.
Overall Good job, but you can do better!
